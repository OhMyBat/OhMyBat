A round-based, casual multiplayer FPS where players *are* the SCPs.  


**Built With:**

- Mirror for Networking  
- Custom Systems, Lore, and uh...Cool Stuff™  

**Inspired By:**  
- *SCP: Secret Laboratory (kinda, barely. like 2%)*  
- *Late night YouTube dives + my brain at 4am on a weekend*   

**Alpha Goal:**  
🗓️ December 20, 2026 *(maybe... probably... we'll see)*

## 📚 Currently Learning
- 🐍 **Python** – ez scripting ( i already learned this but not by heart yet )
- 🖥️ **C** – for OS/dev stuff (ARM kernel cooking soon)  
- ⚙️ **C++** – because why not suffer 💔  
- 🦀 **Rust** – memory-safe and cool

## ⚡ Fun Facts
- Can name more fighter jets than state capitals  
- Thinks tanks should be street legal  
- Has more WIPs than finished projects (don’t @ me)  
- Probably drawing random concepts at 5am
